- What is the take home message from the discussion?

//ANSWER: Full stack DEV needs a specific mindset and personality (Problem-Solver, Perfectionist, Creative mind, Master of your Time, Patient and Prudent Mind, Multitasking, Communicator). Also the certification will help. I would say that if you like coding, you can learn it and you can do the work.
