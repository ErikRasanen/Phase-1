# Group discussion 2

Discuss in Groups how you approach the following challenge, from high level stand point (no coding)

> You want to make a shopping list that allows you to dynamically add items to the list using a form input and button. When you add an item to the input and press the button:

- The item should appear in the list.
-  Each item should be given a button that can be pressed to delete that item off the list.
- The input should be emptied and focused ready for you to enter another item.

The finished demo will look like the screenshot in the img folder: `screenshot`
